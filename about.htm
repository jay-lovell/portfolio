            <p>In 2020, faced with redundancy, I decided to embark upon a career change. I was lucky enough to secure a position on the IT Graduate Scheme at Admiral Insurance, and I'm currently training for the role of Junior Software Engineer.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I'm studying towards a BSc (Hons) Computing and IT with the Open University.</p></td>
